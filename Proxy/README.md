# Proxy

Source of information: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/proxy

Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you 
provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. 
A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing 
you to perform something either before or after the 
request gets through to the original object.

The proxy pattern is used to provide a surrogate or 
placeholder object that controls access to another 
object, which may be remote, expensive to create, 
or sensitive. The proxy object forwards requests to 
the real object and may add additional functionality.
