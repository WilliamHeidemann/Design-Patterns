### Gateway Pattern vs Proxy Pattern

The Gateway pattern and the Proxy pattern are similar in that 
they both provide an intermediary interface to a complex 
subsystem. However, there are some key differences between the 
two patterns:

Purpose: The main purpose of the Gateway pattern is to provide 
a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, while the main 
purpose of the Proxy pattern is to provide a surrogate or 
placeholder for another object in order to control access to it.

Interface: In the Gateway pattern, the Gateway class typically 
implements the same interface as the complex subsystem, so that 
it can accept the same requests as the subsystem. In the Proxy 
pattern, the Proxy class typically has a different interface 
than the object it is representing, so that it can accept 
different requests or add additional functionality.

Implementation: The Gateway pattern is often implemented 
using composition, where the Gateway class contains an 
instance of the complex subsystem and delegates requests to it. 
The Proxy pattern is often implemented using inheritance, 
where the Proxy class extends the object it is representing 
and overrides its methods to add additional functionality 
or control access.

### Gateway Pattern vs Facade Pattern

The Gateway pattern and the Facade pattern are similar in 
that they both provide a simplified interface to a complex 
subsystem. However, there are some key differences between 
the two patterns:

Purpose: The main purpose of the Gateway pattern is to 
provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, 
while the main purpose of the Facade pattern is to provide 
a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, 
hiding the complexity of the subsystem from the client.

Interface: In the Gateway pattern, the Gateway class 
typically implements the same interface as the complex 
subsystem, so that it can accept the same requests as the 
subsystem. In the Facade pattern, the Facade class 
typically has a different interface than the subsystem it 
represents, providing a simplified interface to a set of 
subsystem interfaces.

Implementation: The Gateway pattern is often implemented 
using composition, where the Gateway class contains an 
instance of the complex subsystem and delegates requests 
to it. The Facade pattern is often implemented using 
aggregation, where the Facade class has references to the 
objects in the subsystem and delegates requests to them.
